# sprint4-mlb-hitting

This is a basic app that shows MLB hitting stats.
The user can select the stat they would like to see then the user can see the stat by player or select the checkbox and view the stats by position.


*This app is running very slow but it does work.* I preprocessed the dataframe in hopes that would speed up the app but it has no apparant change on the speed.  Maybe it runs slow because I'm using a free version of Render?? 

Everything loads quickly except the plots. Please be patient and let the plots load.
